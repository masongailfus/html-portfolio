<h2>My top 3 favorite games I've played</h2>
<hr />
<h3>HALO</h3>
<p>The series of games I will always come back to. Great gameplay, great story and great fun.</p>
<h3>KOTOR</h3>
<h4>Knights of the Old Republic</h4>
<p>One of my favorite Star Wars games ever made. Replayability is high. I wish they would redo it.</p>
<h3>GTA 5</h3>
<p>A game I play if I just wanna be reckless and do whatever I want. Getting the police up to 5 Stars and surviving as long as possible is always fun.</p>
